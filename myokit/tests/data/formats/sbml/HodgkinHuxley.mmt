    This is an implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the electrical
    behavior of the squid axon membrane from: A quantitative description of
    membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.
    A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley. (1952 ) Journal of Physiology 119(4): pp
    500-544; pmID: 12991237 . Abstract: This article concludes a series of
    papers concerned with the flow of electric current through the surface
    membrane of a giant nerve fibre (Hodgkin,Huxley & Katz, 1952; Hodgkin &
    Huxley, 1952 a-c). Its general object is to discuss the results of the
    preceding papers (Part I), to put them into mathematical form (Part II) and
    to show that they will account for conduction and excitation in
    quantitative terms (Part III). This SBML model uses the same formalism as
    the one described in the paper, contrary to modern versions: * V describes
    the the membrane depolarisation relative to the resting potential of the
    membrane * opposing to modern practice, depolarization is negative , not
    positive , so the sign of V is different * inward transmembrane currents
    are considered positive (inward current positive), contrary to modern use
    The changeable parameters are the equilibrium potentials( E_R, E_K, E_L,
    E_Na ), the membrane depolarization ( V ) and the initial sodium and
    potassium channel activation and inactivation coefficients ( m,h,n ). The
    initial values of m,h,n for the model were calculated for V = 0 using the
    equations from the article: n t=0 = _n V=0 /(_n V=0 + _n V=0 ) and
    equivalent expressions for h and m . For single excitations apply a
    negative membrane depolarization (V < 0). To achieve oscillatory behavior
    either change the resting potential to a more positive value or apply a
    constant negative ionic current (I < 0). Two assignments for parameters in
    the model, alpha_n and alpha_m, are not defined at V=-10 resp. -25 mV. We
    did not change this to keep the formulas similar to the original
    publication and as most integrators seem not to have any problem with it.
    The limits at V=-10 and -25 mV are 0.1 for alpha_n resp. 1 for alpha_m. We
    thank Mark W. Johnson for finding a bug in the model and his helpful
    comments. This model originates from BioModels Database: A Database of
