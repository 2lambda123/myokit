``update``
**********

Connects to the Myokit website, looks if there's an update available and if so
downloads and installs it.

Please note: Since Myokit is under active development, the update script may
not always anticipate future changes and so from time to time a manual update
will have to be made.

Example use::

    $ python myo update
