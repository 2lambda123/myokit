Style guide:
 - Don't bother with :param: and :type: indications. If a parameter needs
   explaining write a short paragraph about it. If it's obvious then don't
   waste the space.
 - Same goes for :returns: This has the benefit of reducing the time spent
   writing obvious documentation, hopefully increasing the time spent
   writing helpful documentation. It'll also make complicated functions and
   methods stand out more.
 - Header 1: * below + above
 - Header 2: = below
 - Don't follow a header with another header
 - Be careful not to place "module" statements above the page's first
   header! (These add a <span> which stops the <hx> from being the
   :first-child, which means you get extra padding at the top of the page)
