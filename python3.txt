Python3 issues
==============

- [ ] str, unicode, bytes

- [x] Exceptions no longer have a message attribute.
      Instead, we should use str(exception)

- [x] assertRaisesRegexp is now assertRaisesRegex

- [x] SubCapture doesn't work, obscures errors from compilation

- [x] __nonzero__ is now called __bool__

- [ ] raw_input is now input


C stuff
-------

- [ ] Integers are now longs

- [ ] Modules are now intialised differently

- [ ] PyString_AsString
      This gave access to string buffer, no longer possible with unicode!
