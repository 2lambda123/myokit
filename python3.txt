Python3 issues

- Exceptions no longer have a .message. Instead, we should use str(exception)



- SubCapture doesn't work, obscures errors from compilation
- Compilation doesn't work

- C stuff:

    - Integers are now longs

    - Modules are now intialised differently

    - PyString_AsString
        This gave access to string buffer, no longer possible with unicode!
