Python3 issues
==============

- [ ] str, unicode, bytes

- [x] Exceptions no longer have a message attribute.
      Instead, we should use str(exception)

- [ ] assertRaisesRegexp is now assertRaisesRegex

- [ ] SubCapture doesn't work, obscures errors from compilation

C stuff
-------

- [ ] Stuff doesn't compile

- [ ] Integers are now longs

- [ ] Modules are now intialised differently

- [ ] PyString_AsString
      This gave access to string buffer, no longer possible with unicode!
