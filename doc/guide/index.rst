In this section, a brief introduction to working with Myokit is given.

The section :ref:`guide/model` describes the way a model is represented in
Myokit.
This section discusses components, variables, equations and their
relationships.

In :ref:`guide/model-writing` a complete example of a model implementation is
given, including the model definition, a protocol and an embedded script.

:ref:`guide/simulations` covers the basics and details of running a simulation.

Myokit can work with different visualization tools.
A popular choice among Python users is ``Matplotlib``.
The section :ref:`guide/matplotlib` covers some basic commands needed to plot
your graphs using Matplotlib.
